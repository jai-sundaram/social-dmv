SOCIALDMV 

About:
This project was created to address one of the problems I faced in regards to socializing. Making plans to go out with my friends would take a very long time as we did not have a good idea of the various venues
present in the DMV. Furthermore, we had numerous criteria, and struggled to find results on google that matched these critera. As a result, we ended up revisiting the same locations, limiting exposure to new places.
This project addresses this issue by displaying a variety of social venues in the DMV area, and offers information I believe is important when choosing a place to go to. Furthermore, it provides a sorting functionality
which provides power to the user as to what kind of venue they are interested in.

How it was built:
I used the ReactJS framework to develop the core functionality of the project, and used the Google Places API to acess venue information. I utillized TailwindCSS to style the project.
